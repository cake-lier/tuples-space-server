/** A coordination medium to be used to exchange pieces of information and coordinate with other entities, implemented to be used

  *
  * A "tuple space", in general, is what is called a coordination medium. It is a way to coordinate the entities that participate
  * in its use. It is a way to exchange information, more specifically tuples and with this implementation [[JsonTuple]]s, and to
  * coordinate the different actions of the entities. For a "tuple space", the coordination happens with the same operations that
  * let to write and to read into the space. The basic operations, "in" and "rd", have a suspensive semantic, which means that
  * their completion suspends until a tuple able to complete them is found in the space. In this way, similarly to the "future"
  * data structure, the execution can be paused until the result is ready. Matching a tuple means to have a template to be used by
  * the operation for matching, which in this implementation is a [[JsonTemplate]].
