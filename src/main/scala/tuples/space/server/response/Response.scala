/** A response that a [[io.github.cakelier.tuples.space.client.JsonTupleSpace]] can receive from its server.
  *
  * This trait represents a generic response that a [[io.github.cakelier.tuples.space.client.JsonTupleSpace]] client can receive
  * after sending a corresponding [[io.github.cakelier.tuples.space.request.Request]] to the server it has connected to. Responses
  * can be divided in two categories: proper responses and meta-responses. The first ones are used to carry data from the server
  * to the client, sometimes just the content of the corresponding request to signal that the operation completed with success.
  * Some other times, they have a proper content in addition, which represents the result of the operation. Their content can be a
  * single [[JsonTuple]], a [[Seq]] of them etc. Meta-responses are instead used for carrying metadata from the server to the
  * client, for example for signalling that the connection has been established with success and a new id is provided to the
  * client or that the client wants to use another id instead.
